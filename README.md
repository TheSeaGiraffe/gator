## `gator`

This is an RSS feed aggregator created as part of the "Build a Blog Aggregator" course on
[Boot.dev.](https://www.boot.dev/) It's a CLI application that allows users to manage
their own personal collection of RSS feeds. `gator` is still in its early stages so it's
functionality is currently severely limited but that will change as I continue progressing
through the course.
